    <p> As soon as ___ stepped into the brightly lit cafe he was met with a gush
         of warm air with the smell of roasted coffee beans and pastries 
         brimming the small cafe. ___ could see the overall layout of the cafe 
         with just a quick glance.  In the corner of the cafe is a <em>‘L’</em> shaped 
         counter serving as a place for the coffee machines and two workers 
         busily taking orders. ____ was impressed by the agility of the two 
         workers as they received orders from customers in person and through 
         phone calls every so often. ___ spent some time waiting in line to 
         order a chicken sandwhich, as he was quite hungry after not eating this 
         morning. After recieving the chicken sandwich, ___ walked towards 
         the wood counter facing the windows. As ___ settled down, the wood 
         counter felt warm to the touch compared to the chilly 
         cold wind outside the cafe.
